Attribution Modelling

Our goal is to go through a set of channels of marketing campaigns before a customer converts. 

Rule-Based Engine: Single-Touch Attribution Models
These focus on giving a 100% carrier credit to only one touch point in a user journey, by which we mean a marketing campaign channel. A last-touch attribution model may give 100% credit to a customer's most recent touch point. A last non-direct touch attribution may look at traffic that was guided to your website from another source, like a link on a Twitter post, and observe the last touch point in this journey.

Last-Touch Attribution Model
Here, we assign 100% of the carrier credit to the last marketing touchpoint. The argument behind this approach is that the last touch is all that matters because it resulted in the actual conversion, but in reality, it doesn't tell the whole story.

First-Touch Attribution Model
Here, a customer's first marketing interaction will receive 100% of the coversion credit. If one is mainly focused on widening [the] top of [their] funnel, this is a useful model. It highlights the channels that first introuced a customer to [the] brand. The problem with this model is that it ignores all subsequent touches, and therefore provides no insight into down-funnel metrics.

Last Non-Direct Attribution Model
This model ignores direct traffic, and it assigns 100% of the credit to the last channel the user engaged with before making a conversion. This is best used if one wants to understand effectiveness of their final marketing activities without direct traffic getting in the way of their analysis. However, this is still ignoring the other campaigns and channels with which the customer interacted.

Rule-Based Engine: Multi-Touch Attribution Models
There might be a lot of biases involved in single-touch attribution models: 100% credit for one channel won't usually make practical sense. These include linear atribution models, position-based (U-shaped) models, position decay attribution models, among others.

Linear Attribution Model
The Linear Attribution Model gives each touchpoint across the buyer journey the same amount of credit toward driving a sale; it values every touchpoint evenly. This model is easy to implement and is better than all the single-touch attribution models. The disadvantage here is that in reality, consumers aren't equally impacted by every kind of channel.
